\subsection{Portable/Reusable Body}
\subsubsection{Description}
The main body of the Polar FarmBot should be movable from one plot to another. The mobile body of the Polar FarmBot must be self contained and require nothing from the support post but a supply of electricity and liquids to dispense. Once the FarmBot has been given a layout for a new plot, it should be able to operate on the contents of that plot without reconfiguration beyond plot selection when moved back to that plot.

Plans for a Portable Polar FarmBot will be provided by Team Demeter
\subsubsection{Constraints}
In order to be mobile the Polar FarmBot must be able to disconnect from any permanently installed fixtures. All connectors for liquid and electrical input must have the ability to connect and disconnect. Optionally, the procedure can be designed to be done without tools.
\subsubsection{Priority}
The mobility of the FarmBot is low priority and not necessary to the core functionality of the machine.
