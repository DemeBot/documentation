\subsection{LARGE SCALE FARMBOT (EXTENSION)}
\subsubsection{Description}
The FarmBot will be extendable to at least cover a 16 feet by 16 feet plot and will able be used in large scale to minimize the manpower as per the customer needs. The same working principles will be applied in the large scale FarmBot too. This feature will not be included in the current version.
\subsubsection{Source}
Customer
\subsubsection{Constraints}
The production cost will be higher.
\subsubsection{Priority}
Moderate

\subsection{Assembly Instructions}
\subsubsection{Description}
Assembly instructions must contain enough detail for a technically literate user to construct the physical robot as well as install any required softwares.
\subsubsection{Source}
Assembly instructions will be provided by Team Demeter
\subsubsection{Constraints}
Assembly instructions must be clear enough to follow. Instructions may be transmitted through static mediums.
\subsubsection{Priority}
Assembly instructions are high priority, but not critical for completion of the project.

\subsection{Assembly Instructions - Parts List}
\subsubsection{Description}
The hardware assembly must contain a complete and comprehensive list of all parts and a minimum count needed for complete construction of the robot.
\subsubsection{Source}
Parts list will be provided by Team Demeter
\subsubsection{Constraints}
The parts list must contain enough detail to order specific parts to ensure the customer will order the correct parts if they wish to source their own components.
\subsubsection{Priority}
A parts list is critical for replication of the project. Builders will not know what components and how many may be required without a parts list.

\subsection{Assembly Instructions - Software Configuration}
\subsubsection{Description}
The assembly instructions should contain references to the locations, details, and purposes of configuration as they differ from default settings. The assembly instructions will not contain directions on installing or uploading software to the hardware platforms.
\subsubsection{Source}
A software configuration will be provided by Team Demeter
\subsubsection{Constraints}
An unclear guide can lead to improper configuration and hardware damage.
\subsubsection{Priority}
A software configuration guide is not critical for deployment.
