The hardware components of the Polar FarmBot at first will be disassembled and all components will be packed in boxes. All components will be bubble wrapped to control any damage done during shipping and handling. All the complex components will already be assembled and the customers will only need to assemble the arms to the central pole and attach the gantry to the arm. Detailed instructions would be provided inside the box on how to attach each piece to other. The software will be a web based application. A CD will be provided to the customer with the software with easy installation guide.

\subsection{Hardware Packaging}
\subsubsection{Description}
All the hardware components will packed separately. There will be an instruction manual to assemble all the parts. The arms will attach to the central pole with a few bolts and nuts.

\subsubsection{Constraints}
Even though the assembly of the components is supposed to be simple and easy some people might find it confusing. And even with all the packaging, some parts might get damaged during shipping and handling.
\subsubsection{Priority}
The priority for the packaging will be critical. It is very important that the software operates fully for the hardware to start working in its full capacity.

\subsection{Software Distribution}
\subsubsection{Description}
The required software will be installed in a CD and provided to the user. There will be an easy installation process. Once the CD is loaded in a computer the user has to follow few simple guides and the software will be ready to use.
