The proposed design is a polar machine which will consist of a tool gantry, an arm which the gantry will ride on, a pivot which the arm will roatate around, and a wheeled extension at the other side of the arm.
The outer perimeter section will be supported by a pair of motorized wheels which will provide angular motion.
The main arm will conist of a pair of rods and a motorized belt. The mobile ganrty will be attached to the belt to adjust the radial distance of the gantry from the central pivot point.
