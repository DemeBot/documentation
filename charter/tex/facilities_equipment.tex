The development and prototyping of PolarFarmBot will take place in the Senior Design Lab.
All the hardware design and development will take place in the lab during the Senior Design I semester. We will be using the 3D printers to make housings for the motors and various parts on the robot.
We will also be using common tools such as the drills, screwdrivers, saws, and Allen wrenches from the Senior Design Lab.
Tools that are not available from the lab will be donated or leased from Partsmaster, a company helping out our team in the building of the robot. If there is special heavy machinery that we need that is not available in the Senior Design Lab nor Fab Lab, Partsmaster has said we can use any machinery in their shop.
Upon building the successful prototype, our team will implement a full scale 13' x 13' robot in the backyard of one of our team member's home.
