This project is an offshoot of a senior design initiative. It was origially proposed as a smart irrigation system which would use low cost wirelessly connected nodes to control water distribution and collect sensor data across a crop field. That initial proposal was rejected by the Product Owner due to insufficient hardware complexity and the FarmBot was recommended as an alternate goal. The design team proposed an alteration of the FarmBot design inspired by center pivot irrigation systems, which was accepted by the Product Owner. We chose to pursue that design because it addresses a very common problem in the modern consumer world: The inability to grow foods at home. Due to tight schedules and the exhausting work many people operate with, it is simply not feasable for them to grow a garden. The FarmBot is designed to allow these individuals to grow crops at home, but requires an initial investment most Americans are not willing or able to commit to. We wish to increase the feasability of automated home gardening and lowering the cost of entry with this alternate design.
