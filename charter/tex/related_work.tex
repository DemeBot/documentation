Our team is trying to replicate a machine called the FarmBot Genesis but we are trying to make our FarmBot better and cheaper. FarmBot Genesis is the first FarmBot designed and prototyped that helps you grow plants. Genesis is a small scale FarmBot primarily constructed from V-Slot aluminum extrusions and aluminum plates and brackets. Genesis is driven by NEMA 17 stepper motors, an Arduino Mega with a RAMPS shield, and a Raspberry Pi 3 host computer. These electronics were chosen for their great availability, support, and usage in the DIY 3D printer world. Genesis can vary in size from a planting area as little as 1m2 to greater than 50m2, while accommodating a maximum plant height of about 1m. With modifications to some of the structural component sizes and an alternative X-direction drive system, the Genesis concept could likely scale up to a 1000m2 planting area and a maximum plant height greater than 2m. The hardware is designed to be durable, easily assembled and modified with common tools, constructed from largely off-the-shelf components, and manufactured with readily available processes and materials. The FarmBot genesis moves in a XY-axis and it plants seeds, waters them, checks the status of soil and helps destroy weeds.
