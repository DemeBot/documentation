Farming does not have to be a full time job but in the traditional way of farming a lot of time and space is required. A problem with traditional farming is that the general people who work 8-5 job cannot aside enough time and generally does not have enough space to farm using traditional method. To address those problems, we are building a farming robot called Frambot. It is a small robot which replaces humans to some extent from farming. Farmbot requires a small space as well as a very little attention. Farmbot can be an effective solution.
