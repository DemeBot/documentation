This project will be considered successful if the outcome is able to replicate the core functionalities dislpayed by the FarmBot, namely the ability to plant seeds, water plants, monitor growth, and kill weeds. That goal will require the construction of a polar coordinate robotic platform which is compatiable with the FarmBot tooling system as well as a series of modifications to the FarmBot software backend to allow the system to operate in the new platform envelope.
